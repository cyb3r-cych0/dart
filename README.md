## In this program:
    ''''
    We define an interface Animal with a method makeSound.
    We create a base class LivingBeing with a property name and a method breathe.
    The Dog class extends LivingBeing, implements Animal, and overrides the makeSound method.
    In the main function, we read data from a file (dog_data.txt) to initialize an instance of Dog.
    We then demonstrate the use of a loop to make the dog bark three times.
