## In this program:
    ''''
    We define an interface Animal with a method makeSound.
    We create a base class LivingBeing with a property name and a method breathe.
    The Dog class extends LivingBeing, implements Animal, and overrides the makeSound method.
    In the main function, we read data from a file (dog_data.txt) to initialize an instance of Dog.
    We then demonstrate the use of a loop to make the dog bark three times.

## Advanced OOP Dart
    Defined two classes, Student and Teacher, with properties for name, age, and additional information specific to each class.
    Each class has a method (printStudentInfo and printTeacherInfo) that prints out the respective object's information.
    Created a third class School that creates instances of Student and Teacher objects and calls the methods to print out their information.
    In the main function, created an instance of the School class and call the createObjectsAndPrintInfo method to demonstrate creating student and teacher objects and printing their information.
